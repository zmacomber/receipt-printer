Receipt Printer was made specifically for Midcoast Baptist Church in Brunswick, Maine, USA, but I wanted to make the code available for public use.  It's a Java Swing app (1.7) that has a tab for Addresses, Designations (otherwise known as accounts), Receipts and Reports that contains a Total Yearly Amount Report.

It was built using Eclipse.

The ReceiptPrinterTest project contains JUnit test cases.  I used the Test-Driven-Development approach for much of the project but not everything.

The ReceiptPrinter.jar, notes.txt and Application.properties files are available for download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/receiptprinter/
